Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is incredibly useful for us to be able to keep track of changes in our code, meaning that if we have partially-correct solutions and then accidentally break our code later, as long as we committed our previous code, then we can find a way to easily revert these changes!x

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: The topics for this course are very interesting to me, and the field of data science as a whole is very interesting to me--so I'm looking forward to learning more about working with data!
